## **Sectors and Disasters**

### In this section we looked at when the GDP jumped above or below 2.5%. We were trying to understand what sectors of the market were hit during those major events, and then find out if there were any patterns to which sectors had the fastest recovery.

- IN THIS GRAPH WE COMPARED THE JUMPS AGAINST EACH OF THE SECTORS TO SEE IF ANY INDUSTRY HAS CONSISTENTLY HIGHER VOLITILATY THEN THE REST (*worldbank.com*).

# Conclusion 
## Based on our groups preliminary exploratory analysis as an overall conclusion we found that despite what common knowledge might say. When the market crashes or dips, investing in industries considered "aggressive" would probably reward higher returns. We also noticed that the market is typically quick to recover from a disaster event. Meaning the faster you get in after a crash the better.
