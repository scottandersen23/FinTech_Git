### We are looking at the impact on the US economy when a natural disaster hits. Comparing the effect on individual sectors when the GDP jumps up or down over 2.5% to normal standard deviation since 2000.

## **Sectors and Disasters**

### In this section we looked at when the GDP jumped above or below 2.5%. We were trying to understand what sectors of the market were hit during those major events, and then find out if there were any patterns to which sectors had the fastest recovery.

- IN THIS GRAPH WE COMPARED THE JUMPS AGAINST EACH OF THE SECTORS TO SEE IF ANY INDUSTRY HAS CONSISTENTLY HIGHER VOLITILATY THEN THE REST (*worldbank.com*).

## DEFENSIVE VS AGGRESSIVE SECTORS
- What do you notice about the graph? (Defensive stocks had higher average returns in 11/20 years, Aggressive stocks had higher returns in 8/20 years with 2017 blank.)



## **What sectors do you think had the best recorvery???**

### - Based on this preliminary analysis your best bet would have been to invest in aggressive sectors for slightly higher returns.

### - As an overall conclusion we found that despite what common knowledge might say. It is best to invest in the market right after a crash because in each case when a disaster event occured the market was quick to recover and buying at the low point would give you the best opportunity to make higher returns.
