***"Money without Boarders"***





## **Overview:**
    
Just a decade ago, Kristo Kaarmann & Taavet Hinrikus founded Transferwise in 2011. Kristo was quoted saying the idea came to him shortly after he recieved his Christmas bonus back in 2008.

Working in London, he was paid in Pounds, but had a mortage back in Estonia that needed to be paid in Euros.

When he went to transfer some of his Christmas bonus into his bank account tied to his  Estonia apartment, he noticed that 500 euros were missing. Due to the inflated exchange conversion rate associated with bank fees, he realized he had just donated 500 Euro just to pay his rent. The idea hit him. 

Today, Transferwise acts as an online account for more than 5 million users. Allowing them to send money back and forth internationally at a fraction of the fees that banks charge!


 


## **Funding:** 

Over the course of the next 10 years, the company's value has more than doubled, with total funding reaching $689 million going into 2018, making Transferwise the most valueable FinTech startup in Europe. (Forbes.com - May 2019)

## **Business Activity:**

Transferwise has a company objective to make the exchange of currency between countries as easy and as painless as possible. Their aim is to reduce the foreign transaction fees while providing complete transparency. 

They target international travelers, students studying abroad, freelance workers, small businesses and the average employee who works in a resturant in Italy but lives across the border in Germany and needs to pay his rent.

Using Transferwise compared to a traditional currency exchange (WesternUnion) or a bank is that you can send your money converted and into the hands of the recipient within 24 hours, against the standard of 3-7 business days. 

The way they are able to complete this transaction so much quicker is by using 2 local transfers compared to international transfers that banks use. (Telegraph.co.uk - Aug 2018) 

**One of Transferwise's largest investors, Nimay Mehta, general partner at Lead Edge Capital,** 

...said in a statement from 2018: 
"The world is moving towards a more transparent way of doing business and we want to be part of that. International money transfers represent a multi-trillion-dollar market, until now dominated by banks keeping prices artificially high and transfer times slow. TransferWise has changed all that."

***They now support over 750 Currencies compared to their competitor, Revolut, which supports only 150.***

### Why Transferwise?

Key differentiators start with their smart system: which allows for money to move across borders at the currency conversion using the real mid-market exchange rate that you would find on Reuters or Google. And second is that TransferWise has also built a borderless cash account. A multi-currency account, that lets you hold over 40 currencies to send and spend money overseas easily using their contactless TransferWise debit Mastercard (Telegraph.co.uk -AUG. 2018).

According to Stackshare, Transferwise ranks the highest in...
1. Best Exchange Rates
2. Fastest money transfers
3. Best API Support

Safety is crutial factor when it comes to international currency exchange. Many people feel comfortable with banks, trusting them to be the secure method when in reality, TransferWise is fully regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, and just like large banks and financial institutions, the company verifies its users to protect against fraud and money laundering.

## Technologies 

Below is a list of integrated technology platforms and only a handful of the software integrations that Transferwise uses today to succeed in the market:

## Money *$$$*

TransferWise recorded a net profit of $7.9 million (£6.2 million) for the fiscal year ending March 2018, which almost doubled to $148 million. According to the latest earnings report from September, 2019 (CNBC.com), the company's net profit climbed to 10.3 million euros, up 66% from the previous year. 

TransferWise continues to be one of the most valuable fintech firms in Europe, holding onto positive balance sheets while their london rivals Revolute, reported losses of about £14.8 million 

Revolut’s valuation has seen an increase from when it was last valued by investors at $1.7 billion in April 2018. With an extra $500 million in the bank, the latest round takes Revolut’s total amount raised up to $836 million. This is interesting considering the company's losses doubled in 2018 to £32.8 million. Investors are hoping a focus on subscription-based accounts, where users pay a monthly fee for additional perks, can help boost its bottom line. Anther competitor, Monzo's, losses reached 47 million last year.

The company has 6 million users worldwide and is processing over $5 billion money orders every month. The company, claims it saves customers £1 billion every year in banking fees.

The rise of FinTech companies like TransferWise will no doubt be sending panic into the minds of executives at companies like Western Union, as well as large banks around the world.

I believe Transferwise has a sound buisness plan, it seems to be working with profits growing over the last 3 years. However, if I were to make a reccommendation, I would suggest they add a rewards program and try to setup text alerts for when the recipent has the money in their bank account.

People love rewards programs because it makes them feel like they're getting a little something extra when they buy from you. As a consumer, I can relate and it drives you to come back to that particular store or use that card more oftern so that you can build points. I think this could be one way Transferwise could grab market share. Payment companies want you to use their platform to pay. They make their money based on the volume of transactions running on their system and a rewards program would incentivize purchases. 

They could also take advantage of the rewards by partnering with well known merchants that could allow card users to recieve bonus points or discounts on products when they use the debtcard at their store. I believe this would add to the excitment and encourage customers to use the card more oftern. 

Adding a rewards program to their already silky smooth website and payment platform would not take much implementation. They could easily roll that out by adding the programming.
