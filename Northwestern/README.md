***"Money without Boarders"***





## **Overview:**
    
Just a decade ago, Kristo Kaarmann & Taavet Hinrikus founded Transferwise in 2011. Kristo was quoted saying the idea came to him shortly after he recieved his Christmas bonus back in 2008.

Working in London, he was paid in Pounds, but had a mortage back in Estonia that needed to be paid in Euros.

When he went to transfer his bonus into his account in Estonia, he noticed that 500 euros were missing. The bank had used an exchange rate of 5% less favorable, which is common among banks, and just like the idea hit him.

Today the transfer service acts as an online account for more than 5 million users. Allowing them to send money back and forth internationally at a fraction of the fees that banks charge!


 


## **Funding:** 

Over the course of the past 10 years, the company's value has more than doubled, with total funding reaching $689 million going into 2018, making Transferwise the most valueable FinTech startup in Europe. (Forbes.com - May 2019)

## **Business Activity:**

Transferwise has a company objective to make the exchange of currency between countries as easy and as painless as possible. Their aim is to reduce the foreign transaction fees while providing complete transparency. 

They target international travelers, students studying abroad, freelance workers, small businesses and the average employee who works in a resturant in Italy but lives across the border in Germany and needs to pay his rent.

Using Transferwise compared to a traditional currency exchange (WesternUnion) or a bank is that you can send your money converted and into the hands of the recipient within 24 hrs versus the standard 3-7 business days. 

The way they are able to complete this transaction so much quicker is by using 2 local transfers compared to international transfers that banks use. (Telegraph.co.uk - Aug 2018) 

**One of Transferwise's largest investors, Nimay Mehta, general partner at Lead Edge Capital,** 

...said in a statement from 2018: 
"The world is moving towards a more transparent way of doing business and we want to be part of that. International money transfers represent a multi-trillion-dollar market, until now dominated by banks keeping prices artificially high and transfer times slow. TransferWise has changed all that."

***They now support over 750 Currencies compared to their competitor, Revolut, which supports only 150.***

### Why Transferwise?

A few key differentiators are first, their smart system: which is that the money never actually moves across borders, the currency conversion is done using the real mid-market exchange rate that you would find on Reuters or Google. And second is that TransferWise has also built a borderless account. Like a multi-currency account, that lets you hold over 40 different currencies and send and spend money overseas easily using your contactless TransferWise debit Mastercard (Telegraph.co.uk -AUG. 2018).

According to Stackshare, Transferwise ranks the highest for...
1. Best Exchange Rates
2. Fastest money transfers
3. Best API Support

Safety is another factor when it comes to international exchange. Many people feel comfortable with banks being the secure way to move money, when in reality, TransferWise is fully regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, and just like large banks and financial institutions, verifies its users to protect against fraud and money laundering.

## Technologies 

I am including only a handful of the software integrations that Transferwise uses to succeed in the market below is a list of 7:

- Zapier
- Chargebee
- Pendo
- Elevio

## Money 

TransferWise recorded a net profit of $7.9 million (£6.2 million) for the fiscal year ending March 2018, as revenues almost doubled to $148 million (£117 million).

With its shiny new $3.5 billion price tag, TransferWise has become the most valuable fintech firm in Europe, surpassing U.K. digital lender OakNorth, which is valued at $2.8 billion.



TransferWise has 5 million customers worldwide and is processing $5 billion (£4 billion) of money orders every month. The company, which employs 1,600 people across 12 offices, claims it saves customers £1 billion every year in banking fees.

The rise of TransferWise will no doubt be sending shivers down the spines of executives at companies like Western Union, as well as large banks around the world.

FUNDING:
It means Revolut’s valuation has seen a threefold increase from when it was last valued by investors at $1.7 billion in April 2018. With an extra $500 million in the bank, the latest round takes Revolut’s total amount raised up to $836 million.

He added that it was “striving towards profitability,” something that will be closely watched by investors after the company’s losses doubled in 2018 to £32.8 million ($42.4 million). It’s hoping a focus on subscription-based accounts, where users pay a monthly fee for additional perks, can help boost its bottom line
