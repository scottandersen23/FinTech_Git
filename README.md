***"Money without Boarders"***



## Overview
    
Just a decade ago, Kristo Kaarmann & Taavet Hinrikus founded Transferwise in 2011. Kristo was quoted saying the idea came to him shortly after he recieved his Christmas bonus back in 2008. 

Working in London, he was paid in Pounds, but had a mortage back in Estonia that needed to be paid in Euros.

When he went to transfer his bonus into his account in Estonia, he noticed that 500 euros were missing. The bank had used an exchange rate of 5% less favorable, which is common among banks, and just like the idea hit him. 

Today the transfer service acts as an online account for more than 5 million users. Allowing them to send money back and forth internationally at a fraction of the fees that banks charge!
